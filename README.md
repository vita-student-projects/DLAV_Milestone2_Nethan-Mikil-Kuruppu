DLAV Project: End-to-End Planning for Autonomous Driving
This repository contains an advanced deep learning implementation for trajectory prediction in autonomous driving, developed as part of the DLAV (Deep Learning for Autonomous Vehicles) course project.
📋 Project Overview
The project implements an end-to-end planner that predicts future vehicle trajectories using:

RGB camera images
Vehicle motion history
Auxiliary perception tasks (depth estimation, semantic segmentation)

The implementation showcases the evolution from basic CNN approaches to sophisticated Vision Transformer-based models with multi-task learning.
